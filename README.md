# Finance-Planner

Hello I am Logan.

I'm developing a finance app to track spending. I will be using xamarin along with xcode to develop this app onto my iphone 12. The reason I have opted to use xamarin is that it allows you to develop Iphone apps with C# as I am most familar with C#.

Functionality added so far
- Create tracker
- Add direct debit
- Delete Trackers
- Open created trackers
- Delete all trackers
- Displays how much money they have
- List view of expenses added to tracker
- List view of expenses split into weeks (19/08/2022)
- Display how much money spent each week (19/08/2022)
- Add optional toggle to display how much money you can spent a week until next payment (19/08/2022)

Functionality that I want to implement
- Add optional toggle to display how much money you can spent a week until next payment (Partially done- Displays how much money can be spent a week)
- Ability to edit a expense in case it was inputted incorrectly
- Ability to show expenses graphically over set period of time
